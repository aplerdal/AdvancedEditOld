This build currently works I just can't build it for windows because I am on my linux laptop. I will publish the release when I get home but needed somewhere to store my release message.

## Release 0.1.0
The first release! Looking forward to developing many more updates to make this fully featured, but here is the beginning of that long road. Back to the present here are the currently working features, and a little on how to use them.
(I am on a linux computer right now so I can't give a windows build sadly)

#### Editing Peach Circuit's Layout
More tracks work I just haven't added the UI for it yet, hopefully I can get something working within the week.
#### Compiling track into rom
Just close the editor. Right now there is **NO SAVING** so don't create something you want to keep working on, this release is more like a demo of what will be possible.
#### Loading from rom
Make sure you have a rom with the hash `9d327c030c3e2d9007990518594f70c3340ac56f` and just open it

Thanks for the support through this project and be sure to report any bugs in the issues tab. If this is missing a feature, chances are I have it planned, but you can always ask me on discord. User: `antimattur`
